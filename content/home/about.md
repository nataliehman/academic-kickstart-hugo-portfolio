# Hello,

I'm currently looking for opportunities in starting a new career path as a UX Designer.

My technical experience was developed through working in a small advertising technology company as a Front-end Developer.

I was always curious about having a career in Design, which led me to learn about User Experience. To develop my general knowledge, I have took part in projects that demonstrates the different methodologies used.
